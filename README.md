# DevConnects
DevConnect is a responsive and interactive front-end application where developers can: Create and showcase their personal portfolios. Connect with other developers. Share project ideas and GitHub links. Like, comment, and follow each other's work. Think of it like a mini LinkedIn + GitHub feed tailored for developers.
